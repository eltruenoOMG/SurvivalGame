SurvivalGames - Why it is closed?
============

Since Bukkit Staff deleted by page for posting external links and now they're pissed because they can't affod critics for useless rules, the source is now only here. I transfered the information here as well.

If you want to, you can publish this plugin/edit/sell by yourself.

Other information
============

ToDo/Suggestions/Unfinished things:
- Fix sponsor
- Better block restoring (data sensitive)
- Better scoreboard system (variable, replacer thing, and scoreboard for spectators)
- UUID ranking
- Fix ranking K/D or W/L appearing as "0.00" (easy to do)
- Add /sgm enable/disable (easy to do)
- Add potion effect items to item resolving system
- Setup for item kits (fixed items, for kits; and chance based items, for chests/supply crate/etc)
- Better muttation system, perhaps?
- Add death chest option
- Make video tutorials
- Add option to disable 'one time muttation' per server restart
- Disable item frame breaking

The project is 99,9% in portuguese, 100% in Java. And there are dependencies for successful builds:
- PlayerPoints (v2.0.0+)
- Vault (any version)
- BarAPI (probably any version)

What you should know about Bukkit?
============

* Do not post links for your builds on comment section, publish your file even it takes 4 days for an approval (;

I'm not judging your approval time, your service is free anyway, I'm judging you because YOU CAN'T POST LINKS FOR YOUR LATEST BUILD, YOU NEED TO #@*KING WAIT 4 DAYS YO SEE IF A MINOR BUG IS FIXED

* Do not say bad things about Bukkit staff/service on external links

They have eyes on everything, they'll see what you said one time or another. And they don't like people saying that some rule is useless BEUCASE YOU NEED TO HAVE A JENKINGS TO GET THE LATEST VERSION OF YOUR PLUGIN, BECAUSE JENKINS WILL DENY YOU FOR DOING BAD THINGS WITH YOUR PLUGIN, LIKE DELETING YOUR HARDDRIVE, JENKINS CAN DO THAT, CAN'T IT?

* Do not constantly watch your Bukkit Dev's page, they don't like you helping people and fixing your project, leave it bugged, AFTER ALL, IT IS A FREE SERVICE.

Yeah, I'm a 17 years old pissed guy talking about Bukkit, but everything is true :/

Might I be processed for talking bad things about a service?
============

I don't know, but it is internet, people do that, Spigot is there and everybody that is smart start projects there and not here, because if your plugin have an stack trace with the word "spigot-build1845" they automaticly close your thread and ignore your plugin issue (after all, the plugin isn't working because its spigot's fault, not yours :D )

Oh, and they automaticly close your thread because they don't have files to approve, so they have time to check the forums. Leave the file queue grow, at least IT IS A FREE SERVICE.
